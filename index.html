    <h1>Geography 456 - Geovisualizing Change</h1>

        <p>This course, led by Javier Nazario, investigates the challenges, tools and techniques, and important applications of visualizing and analyzing geographic data that is temporally dynamic. We tackled technical challenges in obtaining, analyzing, and visualizing dynamic processes in space though maps, and discussed the consequences of our choices in how to represent these processes.</p>
        <p> I really enjoyed engaging in the design aspects and creativity that this course fostered, as well as the level of freedom we were given to pursue topics we were interested in. Further, Javier's guidance developed my understanding of HTML, Javascript, and CSS languages.
